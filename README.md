# bplus-tree

This project aims to demonstrate an implementation of B+ trees in Java. A B+ tree is a unique data structure commonly found in 
data storage. B+ trees contains a root, internal nodes, and leaves. Only the leaves store actual points to data. Internal nodes 
have an indexing structure to identify which branch to traverse.
